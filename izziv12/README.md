# Bellman-Ford
## Goal:
Calculates the shortest path from verticie 0 to every Node in directed graph.

## Input:
`n` number of nodees <br>
lines that desribe edges <br>
`(start_node end_node weight)`

## Output:
After each iteration print distances from node 0 to each node. distance to node 0, distance to node 1, ...
