# FFT. <br>
## Goal:
Multiply two polinomials.
## Input:
 First `n` being the size of the polynomials. Two following lines represent the coefficients. <br>
## Output:
Is the coefficients of the multiplied polynomial, and before that are the coefficients of the path that the algorithm took to get to the final answer.
